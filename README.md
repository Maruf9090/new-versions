Current Linux links take you to places like https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=minetest which are really vague and don't make much sense to a lot of people. It would be a huge help to put this at the bottom of the Linux portion (specifically a Debian/Ubuntu portion?):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minetestdevs/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minetest
